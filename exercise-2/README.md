# Exercise-2
As described in `module-4`, you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

In the space below, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in VS Code to make sure it works correctly. See `complete` branch for an example.

 | Course number | Course Title | Instructor |
 |	------------   ------------   ---------- |
